# Stuff learned through Exercise 21

## Variables and Strings

```python
print("string without variables")
print(f"string with variables {var1}")
rounded_number = round(3.14159, 2)
```

The .format() method for strings passing a variable in:

```python
print("string with variables {}".format(var1))
```

Escape Sequences

\n - new line
\t - tab
\ - escaped characters
\a - alert (bell)

Print text across multiple lines using triple quotes:

```python
print(f"""
Multiple lines
inside triple quotes
""")
```

## Input and Output

input() function to get user input:

```python
  var1 = input("Enter a variable: ")
```

input from the command line using sys.argv:

```python
from sys import argv
  print(argv[0]) - prints the name of the script
  print(argv[1]) - prints the first argument passed to the script
  print(argv[2]) - prints the second argument passed to the script
```

Assign multiple variables from argv in one command:

```python
script, filename = argv
```

Prompt for user input:

```python
prompt = "> "
var1 = input(prompt)
```

## File I/O

Open a file for reading:

```python
var1 = open(filename)  # opens a file
var2 = var1.read()  # reads the entire file and stores it in var2
var1.seek(0)  # moves the cursor to the beginning of the file
var1.readline()  # reads the current line of the file
var1.close()  # closes the file
```

Open a file for writing, clear it,  and write to it:

```python
target = open(filename, 'w') #open a file for writing
target.truncate() # clears the file
target.write(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}\n") # writes to the file
```

Check if a file exists before writing to it:

```python
from os.path import exists
print(f"Does the output file exist? {exists(to_file)}") # checks if the file exists
```

One-liner to read from one file and write to another that is memory safe

```python
with open(from_file) as in_file, open (to_file, 'w') as out_file:
    out_file.write(in_file.read())
```

## Functions

Pass arguments into a function to print or to add and return values:

```python
def function_name(arg1, arg2):
    print(f"Function called with {arg1} and {arg2}")
def add_numbers_and_return(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
```
